# SQLiteApp-Android
Android interface for SQLiteApp

SQLiteApp is a simple mobile app that I created to learn the .Net stack and Xamarin. It uses a provided SQLite file with thousands of records of stores and orders placed, and presents the data in an efficient, browsable manner. 

This repository contains the Android user interface for the project, while [SQLiteApp](https://github.com/ParkerKemp/SQLiteApp) provides the business logic.
